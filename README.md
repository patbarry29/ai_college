This repo contains 2 assignments that were to be completed for my artificial intelligence module in 4th year of Computer Science.

The task for assignment 1 was to develop a model to predict base salaries from crowd-sourced salary data. We were given a dataset from levels.fyi, and trained a model using this data, which included features such as Job Title, Company, Location, Years of Experience, Years at Company, gender, and more. Some of these features were discarded while training the model.

For assignment 2, the task was to build an image classifier to correctly identify images between 2 or 3 classes.
I chose to build a convolutional neural network which classified whether an image contained maple tree leaves or horse-chestnut tree leaves, achieving 93% accuracy using transfer learning on a dataset of around 100 images.
